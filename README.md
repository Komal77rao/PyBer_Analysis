# PyBer Analysis and Visualisation


# Overview of Project
In this analysis on ride sharing data, we created several visualizations for Pyber company, to present analysis on the type of city, number of drivers and riders, total fare and average fare. The main purpose of the analysis and visualization was to help Pyber provide better access to their services and determine the affordability for the underserved neighborhood.

## Purpose of the project
In the new assignment, we created a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

### Tools Used

Python 3.8.5 
Jupyter notebook with Metplotlib Library


## Results

The summary of data by city type presented lower number of the total rides, total drivers, and total fare in Rural cities compared to Suburban and Urban cities. The result also presented that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is higher in rural cities than in urban and suburban cities. 
The summary can be found in the following table:

The following pie charts represent the similar results.

The analysis of the ride-sharing data by total weekly fare presented that the rural cities have lower amount of total fare per week compared to the suburban and urban cities. The following line chart was created for better visualization.

### Summary 
From the results, it can be clearly stated that there is disparity among the different city types, especially in rural cities. The data shows lesser number of rides in rural due to which the average fare per ride is higher. 
The business recommendations to the CEO would be to decrease the average fare per ride in rural cities, which could increase the total rides and total fare in those cities.
